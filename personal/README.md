Checkout scripts
=======

The script here just does a checkout of a list of the things I work on for a new linux vm

They're probably generally not useful to the general public

My personal ubuntu gets as much ripped out as possible and still keep unity
and then adds in dev tools

```bash

sudo apt-get install synaptic re2c bison clang cppcheck valgrind gdb git-cola meld nemiver autoconf lcov libxml2-dev

```

I also put on visual studio code with several c/c++ and PHP extensions
