Checkout scripts
=======

The script here just does a checkout of a list of the things I work on for a new vm

They're probably generally not useful to the general public

My personal ubuntu gets as much ripped out as possible and still keep unity
and then adds in dev tools

Also I have to download, build and install to /usr/local/bison a bison 2.7 install (this location keeps it out of my path, so the system 3 bison is used for php 7 builds, I pop it in the path JUST for php 5.6 builds)

```bash

sudo apt-get synaptic re2c bison clang valgrind gdb git-cola meld nemiver autoconf gcov libxml2-dev
 
```

I also put on visual studio code, just because I like it - and use that, vim, and gedit
